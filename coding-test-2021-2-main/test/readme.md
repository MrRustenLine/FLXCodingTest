1. Create a new release from master branch https://github.com/rickiedu/coding-test-2021-2/releases/new
2. Fill in Tag Version field with sth like s3.url.0.1, press Enter
3. Wait for a few seconds and refresh the page to find the generated URL in your release description. (Behind the scene, an github action is executed to generate the download link which is valid for 7 days. Check the Actions tab for more info if you still don't see the link in release description after a cup of coffee)
